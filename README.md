OmniPost
----

Search ChallengePost for projects, straight from your address box! 

 For example, if you attended McHacks a couple of weekends back, and want to search all the projects that were submitted, just type '@' in the Omnibox, press Tab or Space, and then type 'McHacks'. Or, if you have a specific project in mind, let's say TrainerBand, type in 'TrainerBand' instead.
